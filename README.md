## Implementing Naive Bayes from Scratch
Please note that we have implemented Naive Bayes using this ShatterLine Blog (Not-so-Naive Classification with the Naive Bayes Classifier Posted in Baye) as our base. We will be utilizing various images and data from the blog to explain the math and verify the results.

## Naive Bayes:
Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or conditions. It is known as "naive" because it makes a strong assumption of independence among the features or attributes of the data.

The algorithm is widely used for text classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and various other machine learning tasks.
